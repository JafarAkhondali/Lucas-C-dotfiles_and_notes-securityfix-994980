## Personal tasks management
Etherpad is great: it gives flexibility, a copy/paste scratchpad, hyperlinks, plenty of plugins and an history of changes

## Stories
Stories should be clearly defined so there aren’t any misunderstandings between the Development Team and Product Owner about what is being delivered.

A story usually includes:
- Text Description:
The description is often phrased as: “As an X I would like Y because of Z…”. It should explain what is being done for whom and why it is being done.
- Acceptance Criteria:
The acceptance criteria are a list items which are unambiguously either done or not done. The Story is considered to be done at the end of the Sprint if and only if all of the acceptance criteria have been met.

A story may also include:
- Assumptions
Any assumptions without which the story would be difficult or impossible to implement. For example, a Story may assume another related Story has been completed.
- Not Included
If there is any possibility of misunderstanding what is included, it is sometimes helpful to explicitly enumerate what is not included in the Story.
