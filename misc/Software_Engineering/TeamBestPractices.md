## Joining a new team
- talk to a colleague each day (but not for too long, and schedule it) and question him on what he does
- take notes in a file, complete/fix the existing docs & draw diagrams
- quickly get a short-term goal to focus on & follow the 'minimal info' loop:
    * Acquire as little information as possible
    * Acquire information as efficiently as possible
    * Use the information you acquire as effectively as possible
- ask people to have lunch with them (force yourself !)
- ask people for coffee breaks (force yourself !)
- hang cheat-sheets in home toilets to learn stuff
- grasp the whole architecture using [CodeVisualizationTools]
- get along with HR and plan out-of-the-box projetcs with them that will make your team happier

## Leadership
cf. [#gamedev Lead Quick Start Guide] & [Things I was unprepared for as a lead developer]
"tell people what you want them to do instead of detailing what they’re doing wrong" [Criticism and Ineffective Feedback]
Daniel Pink motivational building blocks from "The puzzle of motivation" :
- autonomy: to direct our own lives
- mastery: to get better and better at something that matters
- purpose: to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves

## Team culture building & best practices
- two main tenets: RESPECT & TRUST people.
How to build trust ? Start by trusting others, be trustworthy, build relationships + it takes time [Minimum Viable Bureaucracy] + [TrekOps] + [MAPP] on trust, autonomy & Agile methods in Michelin
- write down team tenets as guidelines for priorities
- define clear team goals with deadlines
- build a team brand: catchy name, logo, slogan... [PP]
- small is good: 2-pizzas team
- make decisions based on data
- allocate some hack time
- rotate unwanted responsabilities [Minimum Viable Bureaucracy]
- whiteboard sessions
- coding style reference, tools to enforce it, code reviews
- regular emails with tips. Or put a one-pager in the toilets, as Google is doing
- [ThePowerOfStableTeams] :
    - Getting teams to sit together
    - Making someone responsible
    - Clarifying mission
    - Knowing your role as an executive: beeing a support for the team
- [DefendingYourTime] : protect from bad planning and burnout.
- draw a technical/functional skills matrix of you team
- [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team] :
    * Two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared:
        - First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion. " if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined".
        - Second, the good teams all had high "average social sensitivity".
    * Psychological safety is "a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up".
    It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.
    * Everyone [shared] something personal about themselves. The team found it easier to speak honestly about the things that had been bothering them, their small frictions and everyday annoyances.
    They agreed to adopt some new norms: from now on, [the team leader] would make an extra effort to let the team members know how their work fit into [the company's] larger mission; they agreed to try harder to notice when someone on the team was feeling excluded or down.
    * No one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office.
    To be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency.
- [Process Hacking]: process exploration days, rotation days, problem boards, reward participants

## Stand-up & meetings
It mush be SHORT (<15min), everybody has to be ponctual, actually **stand-up**, **listen** and **be concise** : [Why Scrum Should Basically Just Die In A Fire]
- What did you do yesterday?
- What are you doing today?
- What is blocking your progress?
- What are your commitments for the week / progression / changes due to blockers or higher priorities

In general, limit meetings by making them informal chats or doing them properly: agenda (skip if empty), few participants, time-boxed, clustered on some days in the week, take notes & record team decisions [Minimum Viable Bureaucracy]

## Retrospectives
cf. [RetrospectiveWiki]
- Content/Pas content/A améliorer/A continuer/A arrêter/Questions
- Drop/Add/Keep/Improve

## Define team metrics
- customer satisfaction
- performance, output data quality
- availability : measured from the client side
- latency
- to fight it and encourage people reducing it, properly measure the technical debt: time & effort to repair; impact frequency, severity & reach; error rates; capacity/headroom

## Ops
![](http://blog.sei.cmu.edu/assets/content/Traceability-Model.png)

![](/Agile_vs_CI_vs_CD_vs_DevOps.jpg)

- [HowToBeGoodAtOps]
- "**Empathy** allows software makers and operators to help each other deliver the best possible functionality and operability on behalf of their customers." [Jeff Sussna & Katherine Daniels](http://blog.ingineering.it/post/72964480807/empathy-the-essence-of-devops)
- monitor everything ! CPU, openFD, procCount... For services: throughput + delay + completness (% of potential src data processed). And store historical data ! Distributed tracing tools: Twitter’s Zipkin and compatible Apache HTrace, Google’s Dapper
- zero config: config is hard to document, hard to update, hard to set up, its persistent state can overlaps with other data
- emails are evil: no guarantee it will be actioned + no guarantee anyone is subscribed + sense of false security as it works from time to time
- when an alarm is raised, alerting tools should give a maximum of *context* on the system state and what triggered it
- prioritize identifying the root cause of an issue and resolving it
- hold weekly/monthly ops review meetings, including:
    * highlights from previous on-call shift: high severity events, metrics...
    * this week's priorities: deployments, hand-over of burning tickets or tickets failing over SLA
- frequently determine operational excellence goals: eliminate the top root cause of tickets, create a runbook/dashboard for a service...
- CMs: cf. [IT Change Management]
- post-mortems, event management & establishing new processes: cf. [PostMortemsPIEIndicator] (PIE = Probability of recurrence * Impact of recurrence * Ease of addressing) https://www.box.com/blog/a-tale-of-postmortems/
) & [Event Management] + trying to orgize it THE DAY AFTER THE EVENT, when it is fresh in people's minds
  * planning for a future where we're as stupid as we are today [5WhysWithHumansNotRobots]
  * if we made an incremental improvment in area A or area B, which would prevent the boradest class of problems going ahead ? [5WhysWithHumansNotRobots]
Learning is the goal during post-mortems (cf. [Learning Through Blameless Reviews] for a nice quick slideshow) + questions examples : [InfiniteHows]
https://github.com/etsy/morgue : PHP based web application to help manage your postmortems, made by Etsy
- use a chatbot for real time alerts (e.g. Hubot in Node.js, can integrate with Jenkins via Janky - Also: Slack, Lita for Ruby, Err or Zulip for Python, cog for Slack / HipChat)
- useful questions to ask yourself when designing an alarms system : [Alarm design: From nuclear power to WebOps]
- [Climbing out of the software death spiral] -> either :
    * comprehensive backlog audit
    * issue bankruptcy
    * new dev "work queue"
- [Google SRE] : "no SRE could spent more than 50 percent of his or her time on traditional operations as opposed to coding"
- keep Ops playbooks

## Deployments
[Immutable Server](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ImmutableServer.html) pattern.
From __fle__ @ AFPY barcamp, Ansible is a good compromise between Fabric, Salt & Puppet: simple & configurable enough + not to "dev-oriented" (cf. also omniti-labs/ansible-dk)

## Documentation:
- Tenets:
    * the key challenge to sustaining a complex system is maintaining our *understanding* of it
    * documentation reduce accidents
    * trouble is, documentation goes out of date -> _instrumentation_ reflects the reality of the system as it exists
    * it is possible to have too little info, or too much, or present it badly
- minimum doc: how to install, how to create and ship changes, roadmap, changelog, glossary, where to get help
- wiki are great ! cf. "Lessons Learned" of AOSA chapter on SocialCalc: "I was able to catch up and start contributing in less than a week, simply due to the fact that **everything is in the wiki**"
    * store meeting notes, tasks list, team & members pages, build processes, design docs, software architecture diagrams...
    * + use it to share useful links, and try to encourage using this instead of individual bookmarks
    * ++ Ops Docs !
    * +++ DASHBOARD !! But dont create [ShittyDashboards]
    * include the wiki as part of task processes : sprints, ops, deployments...
    * get a leader whose goal is to motivate & educate others
    * templaaaaates are awesome. Alt: script page generation (e.g. for dashboards depending on parameters: IP, hostnames...)
- use Doxygen / Docurium for code documentation
- cf. [TeachDontTell], [BeautifulDocs], [AuthoringStyleGuide], [WriteTheDocs], [WhatToWrite]

## Coaching new hires & bringing them up to speed
- [Onboarding and the Cost of Team Debt] = "when employees aren't properly trained, integrated, or managed, they are operating at less than optimal efficiency and "team debt" is accrued"
    * Productivity = Σ of talent * teamwork
    * To improve onboarding:
        - distribute the load of onboarding
        - focus on technical skills, knowledge of company processes, and personal development
- Write docs: cf. Valve & thoughbot handbooks, Amazon wiki
- assign a "buddy" in the team & a "mentor" in the company
- [Bringing Novice Developers Up To Speed] + bookmarks on coaching an intern

## Recruiting
- [HowFuckedUpIsYourManagement?]
- prebrief, debrief, assigned competences, bar raiser
- codility.com & cie
- recruiting shared and detailed: what soft/tech competencies to assess, how to evaluate code, loop prebrief/debrief process... cf. [Five essential phone screen questions]
- STAR -> Probe -> Chalenge
- some soft skills: teamwork, conflict resolution, listening, coordination...
- sample questions:
    * describe me the organisational methods you used on past project to tackle work efficiently. E.g. todo-list, programming journal, task planning software, time & emails management...
    * cf. [FrontendJobInterviewQuestions]
    * cf. [What happens when you type google.com into your browser and press enter?]
    * cf. [JoeStumpTechnicalInterviewQuestions]
- cf. [HowAProgrammerReadsYourResumeVsARecruiter] & [Interviewing is broken] & [We Hire the Best, Just Like Everyone Else] : "Bring them in for a few days, see if they can set up the dev environment, assign them some bugs nobody else wants to fix, have them meet everyone. - Pay them. - Decide if you want to keep paying them."
- [Foursquare](http://engineering.foursquare.com/2016/04/04/improving-our-engineering-interview-process/) :
> "We forgo technical phone interviews whenever possible. They’re typically unpleasant for everyone involved and we felt like the environment of a phone screen wasn’t conducive to learning about a candidate’s abilities comprehensively. Instead we give out a take-home exercise that takes about three hours."
- clearly define your interview process:
    - screening for **potential** or **experience** ?
    - what methodology to use ? what answers are you looking for ?
