Quicksort: stable, constant space usage, worst case O(n^2) if pivot is smallest/largest element, not good if data on disk
Merge sort : stable, O(n) space on arrays / constant space on linked lists, worst case O(n*log(n)), ok if data on disk
TimSort: used by Python, mix of merge sort & insertion sort, perform well on real-word data
Radix / Counting sort: the best for ints
-> Algorithmic complexity attack, e.g. McIlroy sort killer, which build an input to make any sorting quadratic in time

Trie / directed acyclic graph can be + efficient than binary search trees / hash tables

Succint data structures: use an amount of space that is "close" to the information-theoretic lower bound but still allow for efficient query operations, by encoding data very efficiently in-place, so that it does not need to be decompressed to be used.

Hashing:
- 'fuzzy' hashing that gaves same result for inputs that have homologies : http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Context_Triggered_Piecewise_Hashing

Compression:
- Google Snappy (10x faster, 50% worse compression than LZ)
- Google ZÃ¶pfli (5% more compression, 100x slower than LZ)

PID controller: control loop feedback mechanism, using the proportional, integral and derivative values,
    that attempts to minimize the error in outputs by adjusting the process control inputs.
