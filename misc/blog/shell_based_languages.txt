Existing for Python : http://pyshell.sourceforge.net/

What one could do :

- customize the whole the whole prompt in Python:
    - current directory
    - current hostname
    - last return code
    - color indicating sudo / no sudo
    - current time / load
    - system statistics : loadavg, IO, CPU...
    - custom service statistics (from StatsD ?)
    - grep -c error from system logs

    PRACTICAL: could be implemented easily by defining a PROMPT_COMMAND in Python

- define functions that can manipulate the system and executable with handy abstractions like return codes, pipes...

Actually MS PowerShell has an interesting approach with its 'everything is Object' approach
However : verbose, standard naming not good for mnemonic
