## Internationalization (i18n)
"Internationalization is the design and development of a product, application or document content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language."
aka i18n "enables" l10n

## Localization (l10n)
"Localization refers to the adaptation of a product, application or document content to meet the language, cultural and other requirements of a specific target market (a locale)."
"Translation of the user interface and documentation" and more:
- Numeric, date and time formats
- Use of currency (beware the space/comma/point separator !)
- Keyboard usage
- Collation and sorting
- Symbols, icons and colors
- Text and graphics containing references to objects, actions or ideas which, in a given culture, may be subject to misinterpretation or viewed as insensitive.
- Varying legal requirements
- Phone numbers, addresses, social security numbers
- Units

Some traps:
- do you have to distinguish between fr:fr / fr:be / fr:ca (ISO 639-1 namoing convention) ? en:gb / en:us / en:ca ?
- do you have to support various reading directions ?
- whitespaces (! glued to the word before in English, not in French)
